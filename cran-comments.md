- checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... [18s] 
  - NOTE: Maintainer: 'K. Bret Staudt Willet <bret.staudtwillet@fsu.edu>' New submission

- checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... [4s/12s]
  - NOTE: Maintainer: 'K. Bret Staudt Willet <bret.staudtwillet@fsu.edu>' New submission
  - Explanation: This is my first time submitting **tidytags** to CRAN.

- checking HTML version of manual ...
  - NOTE: Skipping checking HTML validation: no command 'tidy' found
  - Explanation: As noted in an [r-source check](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/trunk/src/library/tools/R/check.R), this seems like an issue related to macOS's old version of HTML Tidy and not related to the package being checked.
